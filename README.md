# Key Findings of the Depression Reporting Project

### 1. Project Overview:
- **Objective**: To evaluate discrepancies between self-reporting and healthcare provider reporting of depression in adults, and to develop a predictive machine learning model for identifying individuals at higher risk of being diagnosed with depression.
- **Data Sources**: 
  - **NHANES**: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2018).
  - **NAMCS**: National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2018).
  
### 2. Key Statistics:
- **Self-reported Depression (NHANES)**: 24.5% of adults (1436/5856) reported experiencing depression.
- **Provider-reported Depression (NAMCS)**: 15.4% of adults (1344/8701) were diagnosed with depression by healthcare providers.
  
### 3. Machine Learning Models:
Two models were developed using binary classification techniques:
- **XGBoost**: Showed the best performance in both datasets.
  - **NHANES**: Accuracy: 73.8%, Precision: 44.9%, F1_score: 0.3644.
  - **NAMCS**: Accuracy: 85%, Precision: 54.9%, F1_score: 0.5292.
  
- **Random Forest**: Also performed well but slightly less accurate than XGBoost.
  - **NHANES**: Accuracy: 72.87%, Precision: 42.36%, F1_score: 0.3510.
  - **NAMCS**: Accuracy: 84.55%, Precision: 52.59%, F1_score: 0.53.

### 4. Key Predictive Features:
- **Top predictors in NHANES**:
  - Private insurance
  - Overweight status
  - Arthritis

- **Top predictors in NAMCS**:
  - Lack of chronic conditions
  - Cardiopulmonary diseases
  - Cancer or blood-related diseases

### 5. Statistical Results:
- **Chi-square testing**: Found significant associations between the Depression Indicator (DI) and several key variables such as age, income, chronic diseases, and insurance type.
  
### 6. Feature Correlation:
- A correlation heatmap revealed strong associations between age and Medicare in both datasets, confirming that older populations are more likely to be covered by Medicare and also report depression.

### 7. Hypothesis Testing:
- **Result**: The study rejected the null hypothesis, confirming that self-reporting rates of depression (NHANES) are significantly higher (9.1% difference) than provider-reported cases (NAMCS).

### 8. Conclusion:
- The study successfully developed a machine learning model capable of predicting depression reporting. The model's findings suggest the need for enhanced screening tools for providers, especially for populations with no chronic conditions, to increase depression diagnosis rates.
